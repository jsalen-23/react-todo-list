## Reflection

- The purpuse of this project was to show my skills with React
- The idea was to create a project that had a beautiful and clean render pattern so that anybody with little React knowledge can read through the code.
- LocalStorage was used for keeping user's information "safe" and easy for them to access.
- There was no need to use Context API for this project although a Custom Hook was used that kind of work similarly to Context.
- Styled-Components was used to style the project, with a Mobile-First orientation and CSS GRID to keep the components correctly organized in any screen size.

This project idea came from the learning path of [Platzi](https://platzi.com/home).
